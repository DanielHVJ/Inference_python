    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Python and its statistical libraries to construct confidence intervals for proportions and means.  We will also cover some important points relating to the properties of confidence intervals, and discuss how to use and interpret confidence intervals in practice.  We will use the 2015-2016 wave of the [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) data for all the analyses below.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the NHANES data are a \"complex survey\".  The data are not an independent and representative sample from the target population.  Proper analysis of complex survey data should make use of additional information about the manner in which the data were collected.  Since complex survey analysis is a somewhat specialized topic, we ignore this aspect of the data here, and analyze the NHANES data as if it were an independent and identically distributed sample from a population.\n",

    "The plot above shows for each age band, the point estimate of the difference in smoking rates between genders (black dot), and the lower and upper end points of the 95% confidence interval (blue points).  Based on this plot, we see that in the United States, smoking is more common in men than in women, not just overall, but also in every one of the age bands.  The difference is largest for older people -- for people older than 60, the smoking rate for males is around 30 percentage points greater than the smoking rate for females, while for people younger than 30, the smoking rate for males is only around 15 percentage points greater than the smoking rate for females.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the 95% confidence bands shown above are much wider than the 95% confidence intervals for the data that were not stratified by age.  Stratifying by age leads to smaller sample sizes, which in turn results in wider confidence intervals."

    "## Confidence intervals for the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we discuss how to construct confidence intervals for the mean.  First note that the proportion discussed above is also a mean -- for example, if the data are 0, 1, 0, then the mean is 1/3, which is also the proportion of 1's in the data.  However the proportion has the special property that the variance is completely determined by the mean. That is why we constructed the standard errors for the sample proportion above using p•(1 - p) as the variance.  In general, the variance of quantitative data will not be a function of the mean, as this is a very special property of binary data.  Therefore, in general we must estimate the variance as a separate step after estimating the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the construction of confidence intervals for the population mean of a quantitative variable, we will use the body mass inde (BMI) data from NHANES.  To begin, we calculate the mean BMI for all women and for all men in the NHANES sample."

Note that the standard deviation of BMI within both females and males ranges from around 5 to around 8 depending on the age band.

This is a far greater difference than the mean difference of up to around 1.5 BMI units between females and males.
